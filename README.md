# docker-developer-nifi
NIFI Container image to be used by developers.

The idea behind this docker image is to allow the developer to have the option to have the flow.xml.gz file stored locally while develop a new flow. The main advantage to this approach is that you can restart the container safely and even store the file in a source code.
